libosmscout offers CMakeLists.txt for the overall project and some of the sub
projects. These files are currently not meant to actuall build the libraries
and executables but are mainly used to make the projects available to Clion
(see: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

However if you can add changes to the files so that (part sof) libosmscout
actually build with these files, patches are welcomed!
